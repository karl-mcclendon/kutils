# KUTILS
Kutils is a collection of bits and pieces of C code that I find myself writing for _every single project_ I create in C. That's pretty much it.

There are some design decisions...
* Kutils is self contained. It can link against standard OS stuff.
* Kutils is standard C.
* Kutils does not have any fancy build shenanagains.

I will probably add more stuff to this later.
